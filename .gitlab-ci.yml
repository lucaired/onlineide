    # This is not an optimal solution because the command for setting the repository path is duplicated.
    # It would be cleaner to extend the globally set environment variable MAVEN_OPTS with the part needed here (to skip the tests).
    # However, there seems to be no other reasonable solution for this at the moment.
    # In https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/1809 this problem is discussed and also a workaround is suggested, which unfortunately did not work as expected.
